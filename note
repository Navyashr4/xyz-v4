1. features section stops working properly at around 900px width 
2. If I really want to stop rerendeing on form input. then I have to use useRef or formData
3. way of making label show up only when someone starts typing 
4. decrease form fonts in sm devices so it fits on iphone se



5. make default values read-only
6. make labels also dynamic based on formuale provided 
7. making everything inside form even more dynamic and modular
8. make error messages show up below the form instead of on top as is the case right now

9. switch idx as key for pros with an actual id passed into the object array
10. The specified value cannot be parsed.. error
11. indicate that results have been calculated by auto scrolling to results section or writing scroll to view results
12. make all the animations uniform in terms of time 








HEADER
1. make mobile nav glide into screen smoothly

HERO SECTION
1. clicking on alayze investment has to take a person to analysis section directly

PLACEHOLDERS
1. I wanted to create it more dynamically where it would not depend on index but instead directly use the invType as a key 

THINGS REMAINING
1. Add total score button
2. color and font size of information on investment section. size needs to be fixed for mobile devices. color of headings made purple. 
3. buttons calculate and reset need to be resized for mobile view
4. error checking for form needs to be implemented and on pressing e-> no input to be shown
5. have to fix further resources section
6. Fix heights of the parameter sections
